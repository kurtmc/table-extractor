Looks like a good SQL parsing library

-- To get foreign keys given table name
SELECT DISTINCT
    tc.constraint_name, tc.table_name, kcu.column_name, 
    ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
    ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name 
FROM 
    information_schema.table_constraints AS tc 
    JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
      ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
    JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
      ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
WHERE constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY' AND tc.table_name='machine';

-- To get column names given table and schema
SELECT *
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'central'
  AND table_name   = 'driver_log'
